<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>You most likely came from <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/33739789/">our studio, the bamboozlement</a>, and we welcome you!</p>
<h1>Who are you all, where am I, and why?</h1>
<p>We are users who have, at one point in time, been "bamboozled" on the Scratch forums, however you may ask what we mean by bamboozled.
<br>
To put it simply, we have mistaken a feature that exists within an older version of Scratch, or a feature from a new version compared to an old version, or with our <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/284272/">"other" things we use that modify some site functions.</a> You get the idea.</p>
<h1>Why is this page so short?</h1>
<p>I (Zydrolic) am just lazy currently.
<br>
Hence why it's been a bit rushed and looks so odd, plain text on a dark background... It'll change sometime, hopefully, perhaps with even a logo and better done page...</p>
<h1>Why is this hosted on "OneShot-Niko.github.io"?</h1>
<p>I'm hosting it (and coded it using my 2 sentences of HTML knowledge), lazy to get a custom domain name and properly configure DNS settings, and I kinda wanna keep my own github pages site rather than outright delete it.</p>
<h1>Why was I invited?</h1>
<p>You simply got bamboozled at one point in time, there's no obligations to accepting, feel free to outright ignore and walk past. If we or anyone inviting people missed something along the lines of "Don't invite me to studios." - Then my apologies lol.</p>
<h1>This page may be redone (very) soon.</h1>
 <!-- studio is now owned by medians-->
