  <h1>Unofficial QaS Directory 5 Temporary Questions Archive (WIP)</h1>
  <h2>Latest archival: 2023/12/22 10:17 (24 hr, GMT+1:00) Will delete on request of the 5th QaS Directory owner, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Sliverus/">Sliverus</a>)</h2>
  <p>Note that questions that are moved from Temporary Questions <bold>WILL</bold> be removed from here.</p>
  <h3><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/726606/"><bold>Q: Why were the forums down for seven days?</bold></a></h3>
  <p>A: The Scratch Team replaced the forum filter with a new one. They also got rid of the mobile version of the forums.
    <br>
    Finally, New Scratchers are no longer able to post in the forums. These changes required about seven days.</p>
  <h3><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/731002/"><bold>Q: Why are Japanese projects so popular?</bold></a></h3>
  <p>It's important to keep in mind that this site is for kids. Many kids are interested in Japanese culture (e.g. anime, video games, etc.), so these projects tend to be very popular. In reality, few Scratchers are from Japan.
